    "1) If we label customers as churned and not churned then use standard supervised machine learning we will not be able to predict the time at which new customers will churn, and that is what we are really interested in knowing so that we can prevent the customers from doing so.\n",
    "2) I think we do not have enough information to answer becaues it depends on the variables we are looking at. If we are looking at the Kaplan-Meier survival curve in the lecture customers who had longer tenure were more likely to leave early. So I think that customer B is more likely to leave. If the customer is a senior citizen or not also could play a role into this since senior citizens are more likely to churn earlier. If we are looking at the Cox proportional hazards model it would be dependant on a lot of different factors. Since we determined that survival analysis is more correct however I am more inclined to believe the first time.\n",
    "3) We can interpret it as data that is out of the range and has been extrapolated."

    "Write up your analysis from hw5 or any other assignment or your side project on machine learning in a \"blog post\" or report format. It's fine if you just write it here in this notebook. Alternatively, you can publish your blog post publicly and include a link here. (See exercise 4.3.) The target audience for your blog post is someone like yourself right before you took this course. They don't necessarily have ML knowledge, but they have a solid foundation in technical matters. The post should focus on explaining **your results and what you did** in a way that's understandable to such a person, **not** a lesson trying to teach someone about machine learning. Again: focus on the results and why they are interesting; avoid pedagogical content.\n",

Make reference to your specific dataset, model, approach, etc. To check that your reasons are specific enough, make sure they would not make sense, if left unchanged, to most students' submissions; for example, do not just say \"overfitting\" without explaining why you might be worried about overfitting in your specific case.\n",
    "- At least 3 visualizations. These visualizations must be embedded/interwoven into the text, not pasted at the end. The text must refer directly to each visualization.

    "**I will use a project that I am working on for my other course**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "This project is part of a larger research effort led by the UBC Computer Science group studying how people play video games. The team, led by Frank Wood, operates a dedicated Minecraft server where players’ in-game actions are recorded as they move through the world. Managing this type of research environment is challenging, as the group must strategically recruit players and ensure they have enough resources—such as software licenses and server capacity, to support active gameplay. To guide these decisions, the stakeholders have outlined three major areas of interest: identifying which player characteristics predict newsletter subscription, determining which types of players are most likely to contribute large amounts of data, and forecasting peak periods of simultaneous gameplay to plan hardware allocation. My project focuses on one of these broad questions and develops a more specific, data-driven question using variables from the dataset in order to provide insights that support the research group’s operational and recruitment strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question \n",
    "\n",
    "For my project, I have decided to answer the broad question:  \n",
    "**\"What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific question that I have formulated is:  \n",
    "**Can a player’s experience level and age be used to predict whether they will subscribe to the game’s newsletter?**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Overview of *players.csv*\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains the following columns: `experience`, `subscribe`, `hashedEmail`, `played_hours`, `name`, `gender`, and `Age`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **experience** — categorical variable representing the player's experience level  \n",
    "- **subscribe** — binary categorical variable indicating whether a player has subscribed  \n",

    "## Methods & Results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Methods Used\n",
    "\n",
    "For my analysis, I began by preprocessing the `players.csv` dataset, removing unnecessary features such as `gender`, `name`, `hashedEmail`, and `played_hours`. The dataset was then split into a 75% training set and a 25% test set. I set a random seed to ensure reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose **K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)** as the classification model. During the data split, I stratified by the target variable `subscribe`. All predictor columns in the KNN recipe were standardized so they contributed equally to distance calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "I performed **5-fold cross-validation** on the training set to tune the number of neighbours (K). I then used the best-performing K to fit the final model, made predictions on the test set, and measured accuracy and recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Wrangling\n",
    "\n",
    "- I selected the relevant columns (`Age`, `experience`, `subscribe`).  \n",
    "- I applied **ordinal encoding** to the `experience` variable using the order:  \n",
    "  `\"Amateur\" < \"Beginner\" < \"Regular\" < \"Pro\" < \"Veteran\"`.  \n",
    "- I converted `subscribe` to a factor.  \n",
    "- I removed rows with missing values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "The KNN model achieved moderate accuracy on the training set (≈0.75) and test set (≈0.71). This aligns with what I observed in `Fig. 1.0`, where the data was heavily imbalanced toward players aged 20–30 and those with amateur skill levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recall score (≈0.944) showed that the model was strong at predicting the **TRUE** class (subscribers) but weak at identifying **FALSE** cases (non-subscribers).\n",
    "\n",
    "I anticipated these issues due to the limited variability in age and experience. Subscription rates were generally low, and predictor–target correlations were weak. My results confirmed these expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Significance\n",
    "\n",
    "My findings highlight significant limitations in both the dataset and modeling approach. The model is biased toward predicting subscribers, which could lead to poor real-world decisions. The imbalance suggests that **age** and **experience** alone are insufficient predictors of subscription.\n",
    "\n",
    "These variables lack enough variation, and more sophisticated balancing techniques or models may be needed. Ultimately, my findings emphasize that good predictive performance depends not only on model choice but also on **data quality and relevance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Potential Future Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "My findings provide insight into more helpful future research directions. Given the weak correlations among my predictors, I can incorporate another variable in the dataset: `played_hours`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future questions may include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are `Age`, `experience`, and `played_hours` correlated with one another?  \n",
    "- Can each variable independently predict `subscription`?  \n",
    "- Does combining multiple variables improve prediction accuracy?  \n",
    "- Can age, experience, and session time together predict subscription more effectively?\n"
